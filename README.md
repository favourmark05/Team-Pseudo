## Team-Pseudo

This is a team repo, clone the repo to your computer by forking the repo to your github account with the button on the right above then cloning in git bash.

Create a branch with your slack id by typing `git checkout -b <slack id>` without spaces in between your slack id.
For example, I will type `git checkout -b slacker`. This will create a branch slacker in my git which will be available on githun once I push.

Commit and push your code to the branch every night and create a pull request. 
Team lead for your track will review and merge if there are no conflicts.

Please seek help in the Slack team DM if you are facing any trouble.
